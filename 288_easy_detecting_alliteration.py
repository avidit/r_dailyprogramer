Description

Alliteration is defined as "the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the
beginning of adjacent or closely connected words." It's a stylistic literary
device identified by the repeated sound of the first consonant in a series of
multiple words, or the repetition of the same sounds or of the same kinds of
sounds at the beginning of words or in stressed syllables of a phrase. The first
known use of the word to refer to a literary device occurred around 1624. A
simple example is "Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers". Note on Stop
Words

The following are some of the simplest English "stop words", words too common
and uninformative to be of much use. In the case of Alliteration, they can come
in between the words of interest (as in the Peter Piper example):

[ I a about an and are as at be by com for from how in is it of on or that the
this to was what when where who will with the ]


Sample Input
============
You'll be given an integer on a line, telling you how many lines follow. Then on
the subsequent lines, you'll be given a sentence, one per line. Example:

3
Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers
Bugs Bunny likes to dance the slow and simple shuffle
You'll never put a better bit of butter on your knife

Sample Output
=============
Your program should emit the words from each sentence that form the group of
alliteration. Example:

Peter Piper Picked Peck Pickled Peppers
Bugs Bunny slow simple shuffle
better bit butter

Challenge Input
===============
8
The daily diary of the American dream
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Three grey geese in a green field grazing, Grey were the geese and green was the grazing.
But a better butter makes a batter better.
"His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead."
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?
